<main><p>The triadic color scheme uses three colors equally spaced around the color wheel. The easiest way to place them on the wheel is by using a triangle of equal sides. Triadic color schemes tend to be quite vibrant, even when using pale or unsaturated versions of hues, offers a higher degree of contrast while at the same time retains the color harmony. This scheme is very popular among artists because it offers strong visual contrast while retaining balance, and color richness. The triadic scheme is not as contrasting as the complementary scheme, but it is easier to accomplish balance and harmony with these colors.</p>

<p>The traditional primary colors red, yellow, and blue are an example of a triadic color scheme. The colors orange, green, and purple also make up a triadic color scheme, as shown below.</p><br />

<p>Just like analogous, a triadic color scheme is easier to understand than it may sound. Instead of grouping three or more colors that neighbor each on the color wheel, it involves taking three colors that are equally spaced to create visual contrast and interest.  It is often recommended that one color govern the design while using the other two colors to complement.</p><img src="links/triadic.png" width="600px">
	<p>Of course, like any other color arrangement, the palette can be modified once the artist is comfortable arranging them. Consider the above example, where a pastel pink and yellow are joined by a bright blue. While the colors don't follow the guidelines exactly, they still seem vibrant.</p>
